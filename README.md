# Notes

- Serves information

- What ever info you look for on a website has a server on it's own, serving information on what you've asked for. 

- Important part of retrieving information is the url, What you seek for by passing it through the url thats how the server knows what the person searching is asking for.

- A server is like a computer it's a system with a lot of storage and the contents of a specific website/application/software everything will be stored in that server. Example facebook has it's own server it will contain code, databases, files in a system it's self globally by requesting a server that is closest to you.

- Clients are the ones seeking/looking for information (client meaning yourself) 

- 

## How a server works:

- Server listens to a request from the clients and the server gets a response depending on the request sent by the client. Example: Typing something into a URL
