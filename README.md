- Serves information

- What ever info you look for on a website has a server on it's own, serving information on what you've asked for. 

- Important part of retrieving information is the url, What you seek for by passing it through the url thats how the server knows what the person searching is asking for.

Example facebook has it's own server it will contain code, databases, files in a system it's self globally by requesting a server that is closest to you.

- Clients are the ones seeking/looking for information (client meaning yourself)
