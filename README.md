# Notes

- Serves information

- What ever info you look for on a website has a server on it's own, serving information on what you've asked for. 

- Important part of retrieving information is the url, What you seek for by passing it through the url thats how the server knows what the person searching is asking for.

- A server is like a computer it's a system with a lot of storage and the contents of a specific website/application/software everything will be stored in that server. Example facebook has it's own server it will contain code, databases, files in a system it's self globally by requesting a server that is closest to you.

- Clients are the ones seeking/looking for information (client meaning yourself) 

- To be able to fetch a webpage the browser will send a request to the webserver 

- Hosting files is when a web server has to store files from the website for example html docs and their assest.

- It's convinent if you want to store all the files in a dedicated web server. 

## How a server works:

- Server listens to a request from the clients and the server gets a response depending on the request sent by the client. Example: Typing something into a URL 

# APIS

- Stands for Appplication program interface.
- A medium for communication between softwares/applications
- Example: Communication between one software to another.
- A website's API can be used by your app to retrieve information/content/data from the website. 
- When you go into something like google maps and click on a section like "Maps" the website will use the API to fetch the information and display it.
- Responses with data typically come in JSON format. Specificly the ones that are fetching information.
- Using APIS help you use all the features. 
- APIS allow integration of different systems and applications.
- Allow automation and interaction between software components.

# Requests and Responses

- Request is when you're asking for information from the server.
- Responses is giving you information.
- Ways you can request information is by using the URL
- Example: Clicking a link and it takes you to a website.
- When you request from a website the information that is being sent out: 
1. A start-line describing the request to be implemented.

3. A blank line indicating all the meta-information for the request has been sent.

4. An optional body containing data associated with the request (like content of an HTML form) or the document associated with a reponse.
